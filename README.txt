## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis

This project analyzes Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using an online retail dataset from 2010–2011.

## Objective
- Identify customers with the highest lifetime value
- Understand the distribution of customer value
- Segment customers into value-based groups
- Provide business-driven recommendations based on CLV insights

## Key Steps
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, canceled transactions, invalid quantities)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Historical CLV calculation
- Customer segmentation (High, Mid, Low Value)
- Business insight & recommendation

## Key Insight
- CLV distribution is highly right-skewed
- A small group of customers contributes a large portion of total revenue
- Different customer segments require different marketing strategies

## Notes
This project uses **historical CLV**, calculated from past transactions.  
Predictive CLV modeling is not included and can be explored as future work.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
